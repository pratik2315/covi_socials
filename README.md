# Covi Socials

Covi Socials is an Android app made with Android Studio(Kotlin)
The app is inspired from social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook and Linkedin.
This app is made for hospital patients as well as doctors so that they can share their daily life and progress.

Its more important for covid affected patients who are essentially shut down from the outside world. The App helps those patients to
share their stories, track their progress and show it to the outside world. This practice also helps to create awareness about the day to
day lives of covid hospitalized patients.
